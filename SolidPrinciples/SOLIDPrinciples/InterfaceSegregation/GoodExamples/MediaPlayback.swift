//The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in SOLID states:
//"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."
//This means that a large interface should be broken down into smaller, more specific interfaces so that implementing classes only need to concern themselves with methods that are relevant to them.

//‚úÖ Good Example (Following ISP)
//üéØ Why is this better?
//‚úîÔ∏è AudioPlayer implements only AudioPlayable and is not forced to handle videos.
//‚úîÔ∏è AVVideoPlayer implements both AudioPlayable and VideoPlayable as needed.
//‚úîÔ∏è Follows ISP by segregating interfaces into smaller, more relevant ones.
